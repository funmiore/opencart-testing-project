    ## **Comprehensive Test Plan for OpenCart E-commerce Platform**### **1\. Introduction**This Test Plan is created to communicate the testing approach for the OpenCart ecommerce platform. It includes the objectives, the clearly defined scope, the project schedule, identified risks, and the overall automated testing strategy. This document will formally identify the test deliverables and outline what is deemed in and out of scope for the OpenCart e-commerce platform.#### **1.1 Objectives**This Test Plan outlines the effort, resources, and time that will be dedicated to testing OpenCart. The primary goal is to verify the functional integrity, performance, and compatibility of the entire e-commerce workflow, from product browsing to order placement. The plan also incorporates necessary risk management measures and provides a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) guiding the entire process.### **2\. Scope**This Test Plan is created with guidance from the approved Test Strategy to provide a WBS of the milestones, tasks, dependencies, and timelines for the OpenCart testing project. The focus is exclusively on **Automated Testing** and **Non-Functional Testing**.#### **Within Scope (Testing Activities)**- **Automated Testing** (using Selenium).- **Functional Testing** (Automated end-to-end customer and admin workflows).- **Non-Functional Testing** (Performance, Compatibility, Usability).- **Performance Testing:** Assessing response times, resource usage, and stability under load using JMeter.- **Usability Testing:** Verifying intuitive design and ease of use.- **Compatibility Testing:** This test details browser compatibility testing e.g Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Also details compatibility with Windows and iOS operating systems.- **Testing Levels:** Smoke Testing, System Testing, Systems Integration Testing (Storefront and Admin Backend), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Regression Testing.- **Test Techniques:** State Transition Testing (Order Status flows), Use Case Testing, Testing (Browser/OS Compatibility).#### **Out of Scope (Testing Activities)**- Manual Testing (explicitly excluded).- Unit Testing and Unit Integration Testing (Developer responsibility).- Debugging or fixing errors (Developer responsibility).#### **Within Scope (Project Management)**The project management scope is extensive and includes: Identifying Stakeholders, Controlling Project Work (monitoring progress, reviewing logs), Identifying required resources (Software, Hardware), Setting up the automated test tracker, Daily logging of progress, Reviewing and resolving defects after triage, Summarizing the final test execution, Reviewing final outcomes with stakeholders, Defect Closure and Resolution, Finalization of RTM, and Stakeholder Sign Off.### **3\. Assumptions and Risks**### **3.1 Assumptions**The following key assumptions govern this Test Plan:- Unit Testing has been successfully completed by the development team prior to this testing phase.- Database Integration for the storefront and admin backend is fully operational.- The Project Cycle will adhere to the planned dates (Oct 25 to Nov 25).- All automated test tool environments and dependencies will be stable and configured correctly on the operating systems being used.- All Entry Criteria have been met before Test Execution begins.### **3.2 Risks**This section outlines potential negative and positive risks, along with clear mitigation strategies.#### **Negative Risks**- **Slow Environment Preparation (Schedule Risk):** If the server or testing dependencies are not available on time, the schedule will slip. Mitigation: Start the setup of the testing environment and automation tools early, dedicating specific resources to dependency installation and verification.- **Scope Creep (Project Risk):** Uncontrolled requests for new OpenCart features or extensions could destabilize the project. Mitigation: Make the change control process mandatory and perform an impact analysis before any feature change is approved.- **Insufficient Test Coverage (Quality Risk):** Critical e-commerce defects (e.g., in the checkout flow or payment modules) could escape testing. Mitigation: Undertake periodical test case and automated script coverage analysis, prioritizing high-risk areas like payment integration and inventory management.- **Poorly Set Automation Tools (Technical Risk):** Inaccurate or inconsistent test results could invalidate the entire automated effort. Mitigation: Conduct a pilot test and a peer review of the automation tool setup and initial scripts to ensure consistency and reliability.#### **Positive Risks**- **Advance Functional Completion (Opportunity):** If the automated functional testing is completed ahead of schedule. Mitigation: Utilize the additional time by organizing in-depth **Usability Testing** or extending the scope of **Regression Testing** to less frequently used features.- **Successful Automation Tool Adoption (Opportunity):** If the automation suite is fully installed and functional quickly. Mitigation: Put greater emphasis on expanding the automated test coverage; integrate the automation suite into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for continuous validation.### **4\. Test Approach**A Bottom-Up approach is being implemented, leveraging familiarity with OpenCart's structure to create highly targeted tests. The strategy is purely focused on automation and non-functional testing.### **4.1 Automated Tests**Automated testing forms the core of this plan, focusing on achieving high repeatability and coverage efficiency for regression-prone features.- **Tools:** **Selenium WebDriver** will be used to record and execute web UI tests, ensuring consistent functionality across various browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).- **Focus Areas:** Automated scripts will cover high-traffic and critical customer workflows such as:  - **Customer Registration and Login.**  - **Product Search and Catalog Browsing.**  - **Full Checkout Flow** (Adding item to cart, navigating to checkout, filling dummy payment/shipping).  - **Admin Backend:** Order creation/status update and inventory management.### **4.2 Non-Functional Testing Using JMeter****JMeter** is utilized to assess the quality of the OpenCart platform beyond basic functionality, addressing a key stakeholder requirement.- **Performance Testing:** Emulating multiple concurrent users browsing the product catalog and initiating the checkout sequence to evaluate application behavior under expected load.- **Stress Testing:** Finding the system's breaking point under extreme conditions to identify potential crashes or severe degradation in service.- **Load Testing:** Measuring the application's response time, throughput, and resource utilization to ensure the platform can handle expected user traffic and maintain scalability.### **5\. Test Environment**### **5.1 Environments and Components**The testing will be focused on the following platform components:- **Web Platform:** Laptop/Desktop running Windows OS with browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). **Middleware:** **XAMPP** (Apache, PHP, MySQL) configured for the OpenCart installation.### **5.2 Required Software and Utilities**The following tools are necessary to support the automated testing effort:- **Browsers:** Firefox, Edge, Chrome.- **Testing Tools:** Selenium IDE, **Selenium WebDriver**, Eclipse (for creating WebDriver test cases).- **Non-Functional Tools:** **JMeter** (Performance/Load/Stress Testing) and **Burp Suite** (Security Testing).- **Middleware:** **XAMPP**.- **Target Platform:** **OpenCart** application.- **Reporting:** Microsoft Project, Word, Excel and GitHub.### **6\. Milestones, Deliverables, and Timelines**The project adheres to the schedule and resource allocation defined in the MS Project Plan.#### **Key Milestones and Timelines**The project cycle spans from May 6th to August 10th. Key milestones include:- **Develop Test Plan:** Complete by 10-25-25.- **Identify Automate Testing Features:** Complete by 10-25-25.- **Test Case Development:** Complete by 10-27-25.- **Test Environment Setup:** Complete by 10-28-25.- **Test Execution (Automated & Non-Functional):** Dedicated execution phase runs from 10-29-25 to 11-02-25.- **Defect Closure and Resolution:** Complete by 11-05-25.- **Stakeholder Sign Off:** Complete by 25-08-08 (marking project closure).#### **Deliverables**The Simulators team will produce the following essential artifacts by the end of the project:- **Final Test Plan** (this document).- **Project Plan** (Full WBS and resource allocation).- **Automated Test Scripts** (Selenium scripts covering regression and functional flows).- **Test Execution Report** (Detailing test results, coverage, metrics, and risk status).- **Test Closure Report** (Final explanation of the test process, issue solutions, and signoffs).- **Finalized Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).**- **Test Artifacts** (Screenshots, logs, and defect reports stored securely).
